- Registration

### Files:

- HTML Files

## The idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to build an application that can shorten certain URLs and trace the visit count. 

## How everything should work: 
The algorythm that a new user should follow consists of the following:

1) Open the login page, choose the `Create account` option
2) Get redirected to the `Sign Up` page, fill in the form and press the `Create account` button
3) Get redirected to the login page, enter the newly created credentials and press `login`
4) Get redirected to the `Landing page`, where the user can press the `Get Started` button and get redirected to the `Main page`
5) Here the user can enter the URL he wants to shorten and click the `Shorten` button. A new table row and a `**modal window` should appear after that. The user can also click the `Visit Count` data cell to see how many users have visited his short link on specific days (starting from the creation date until today). Another `**modal window` is also provided for that.

**All modal windows are commented in the `main-page.html` file.

### That's about it. However, there is one thing left. Please keep in mind that the websites are "Work In Progress", which means that some html/css/js files may change during updates. Also you can ask for whatever Front-End feature you want to be implemented and it will be so. Good Luck!
