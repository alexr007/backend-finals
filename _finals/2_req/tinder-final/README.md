## The idea of the project

The main idea of the project is to build a Tinder-like application that's useful for meeting new people and chatting with them. 

## How everything should work: 
The algorythm that a new user should follow consists of the following:

1) Open the login page, choose the `Create account` option
2) Get redirected to the `Sign Up` page, fill in the form and press the `Create account` button
3) Get redirected to the login page, enter the newly created credentials and press `login`
4) Get redirected to the `Main Page (landing)`, where the user can either press `like` or `dislike` on a specific user. If the user presses `like` - that account gets moved to the `Favourites` page, where the user can chat with said account. If the user presses `dislike` - the account gets blacklisted.
5) Press the `Go To Favourites` button, get redirected to the `Favourites` page, where the user can chat with a certain account or remove it from favourites.
6) Press the `Chat` button and get redirected to the chat window.

### That's about it. However, there is one thing left. Please keep in mind that the websites are "Work In Progress", which means that some html/css/js files may change during updates. Also you can ask for whatever Front-End feature you want to be implemented and it will be so. Good Luck!
